## Introduction to Event Storming

**Event Storming** is a workshop format for rapidly exploring complex business domains by focusing on **domain events** - meaningful occurrences that domain experts care about. 

### Key Principles Applied

- **Start with Events**: What really happens in our task management domain?
- **Use Business Language**: Events are named in terms domain experts understand
- **Focus on the Past**: Events describe what has already happened
- **Visualize the Flow**: Timeline shows the sequence of business events
- **Collaborative Discovery**: Input from multiple perspectives (developers, business users, domain experts)

### Color Convention Used

Following standard Event Storming notation:

- ğŸŸ  **Orange**: Domain Events (past tense, business meaningful)
- ğŸ”µ **Light Blue**: Commands (actions that trigger events)
- ğŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Actors/Users (who performs commands)
- ğŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Aggregates (business entities that enforce rules)
- ğŸŸ¢ **Green**: Read Models/Views (information needed for decisions)
- ğŸŸ£ **Purple**: Policies (reactive logic after events)
- ğŸ”´ **Red**: Issues/Questions (to be resolved)
- ğŸ©· **Pink**: External Systems (external event sources)

## Task Management Domain Events

### Primary Domain Events Discovered

Our Event Storming session identified these key domain events in chronological order:

1. **TaskCreated** - A new task has been created in the system
2. **TaskStatusChanged** - A task's status has been modified
3. **TaskCompleted** - A task has been marked as completed
4. **TaskUpdated** - Task details (title/description) have been modified
5. **TaskDeleted** - A task has been removed from the system

### Event Characteristics

Each event captures:
- **What happened** (business action)
- **When it happened** (timestamp)
- **Who was involved** (user/actor)
- **Business context** (relevant domain data)

## Domain Analysis

### Business Process Flow

The Event Storming revealed this primary business process:

```
User Intent â†’ Command â†’ Aggregate â†’ Domain Event(s) â†’ Policies â†’ External Actions
```

### Key Insights Discovered

1. **Single Command, Multiple Events**: When completing a task, we generate both `TaskStatusChanged` and `TaskCompleted` events
2. **Event Granularity**: We maintain both generic (`TaskStatusChanged`) and specific (`TaskCompleted`) events for different consumers
3. **Policy-Driven Reactions**: Events trigger automated policies for notifications and analytics
4. **Read Model Updates**: Events update various user-facing views

## Event Timeline Breakdown

### Scenario: User Creates and Completes a Task

**Timeline Analysis** (following Event Storming chronological approach):

```
T1: User Issues "Create Task" Command
    â†“
T2: TaskCreated Event Emitted
    â†’ Updates: Task List View, User Dashboard
    â†’ Triggers: Analytics Policy
    
T3: User Issues "Complete Task" Command  
    â†“
T4: TaskStatusChanged Event Emitted
    â†’ Updates: Task Detail View
    â†’ Triggers: Analytics Policy
    
T5: TaskCompleted Event Emitted (same command)
    â†’ Updates: Task Detail View, User Dashboard
    â†’ Triggers: Notification Policy, Analytics Policy
    
T6: Notification Policy Reacts
    â†’ Sends completion notification via Email Service
    
T7: Analytics Policy Reacts
    â†’ Tracks events in Analytics Service
```

### Why 3 Events in Our Test?

From `test_domain_verification`, we see exactly this pattern:

1. **TaskCreated** (T2) - Generated during task creation with `PENDING` status
2. **TaskStatusChanged** (T4) - Generated when status changes from `PENDING` to `COMPLETED`  
3. **TaskCompleted** (T5) - Generated as a business-specific completion event

This follows Event Storming principles of capturing both **technical state changes** and **business-meaningful events**.

## Bounded Contexts

### Task Management Context

**Bounded Context**: Task Management
- **Entities**: Task
- **Value Objects**: TaskId, UserId, TaskStatus
- **Events**: TaskCreated, TaskCompleted, TaskStatusChanged, TaskUpdated, TaskDeleted
- **Commands**: CreateTask, CompleteTask, UpdateTask, DeleteTask
- **Policies**: NotificationPolicy, AnalyticsPolicy

**Language**: 
- "Task" - A unit of work assigned to a user
- "Complete" - Mark a task as finished
- "Status" - Current state of task progress
- "Owner" - User responsible for the task

### Integration Contexts

**Notification Context**:
- **External System**: Email Service
- **Events Consumed**: TaskCompleted
- **Language**: "notification", "recipient", "template"

**Analytics Context**:
- **External System**: Analytics Service  
- **Events Consumed**: All Task Events
- **Language**: "metric", "tracking", "user behavior"

## Aggregates and Commands

### Task Aggregate

**Aggregate Root**: Task
**Responsibilities**:
- Enforce business rules (title validation, status transitions)
- Emit domain events for state changes
- Maintain task lifecycle integrity

**Commands Handled**:
- `CreateTask` â†’ `TaskCreated`
- `UpdateTaskStatus` â†’ `TaskStatusChanged` + `TaskCompleted` (if completing)
- `UpdateTaskDetails` â†’ `TaskUpdated`
- `DeleteTask` â†’ `TaskDeleted`

**Business Rules Enforced**:
- Task title cannot be empty or > 200 characters
- Only PENDING/IN_PROGRESS tasks can be completed
- Status changes must be valid transitions

### Event Flow Pattern

```
Command â†’ [Business Rules Check] â†’ State Change â†’ Event(s) â†’ Policy Reactions
```

## Implementation Mapping

### From Event Storming to Code

**Event Storming Artifact** â†’ **Code Implementation**

| Event Storming Element | Code Implementation | File Location |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| ğŸŸ  Domain Events | `DomainEvent` classes | `src/domain/events/` |
| ğŸ”µ Commands | Use case classes | `src/application/use_cases/` |
| ğŸŸ¡ Task Aggregate | `Task` entity | `src/domain/entities/task.py` |
| ğŸŸ£ Policies | Event handlers | `src/adapters/events/` |
| ğŸŸ¢ Read Models | API responses | `src/adapters/api/` |
| ğŸ©· External Systems | Infrastructure adapters | `src/infrastructure/` |

### Event Sourcing Alignment

Our Event Storming naturally aligns with Event Sourcing:

1. **Events as First-Class Citizens**: Events discovered in storming become stored events
2. **Business Language**: Event names use domain terminology 
3. **State Reconstruction**: Current state derived from event history
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete business history captured in events

### Benefits Realized

**From Event Storming Approach**:
- âœ… **Shared Understanding**: Clear picture of what happens in the domain
- âœ… **Business Alignment**: Events reflect real business occurrences  
- âœ… **Implementation Guide**: Clear path from domain to code
- âœ… **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new events and policies
- âœ… **Debugging Clarity**: Event log tells the complete business story

### Questions for Future Sessions

ğŸ”´ **Issues to Explore** (Red Stickies):
- Should we have events for task assignment to other users?
- How do we handle task dependencies and blocked states?
- What about recurring tasks or task templates?
- Should task priority changes emit events?
- How do we handle bulk operations (complete multiple tasks)?
