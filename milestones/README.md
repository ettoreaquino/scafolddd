# Tutorial Milestone Verification Scripts

This directory contains milestone verification scripts that serve as "sanity checks" for each part of the Backend Tutorial DDD implementation.

## Purpose

These scripts provide quick verification that each tutorial part has been implemented correctly before moving on to the next part. They act as checkpoints to ensure the foundation is solid as you build the application layer by layer.

## Available Milestone Scripts

| Script | Tutorial Part | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `milestone_part2_domain_layer.py` | Part 2 | Verifies domain layer implementation (entities, value objects, events) |

> **Note**: Additional milestone scripts will be added as we progress through subsequent tutorial parts and GitHub issues.

## Usage

### Using the Makefile (Recommended)

```bash
# Run Part 2 domain layer verification
make milestone-part2

# Run all available milestone checks
make milestone-all

# See all available commands
make help
```

### Run directly

```bash
# Check domain layer implementation
python3 milestones/milestone_part2_domain_layer.py
```

## What Each Script Checks

### Part 2: Domain Layer (Currently Available)
- ‚úÖ Value objects are properly defined and immutable
- ‚úÖ Domain entities generate appropriate events
- ‚úÖ Business validation rules are enforced
- ‚úÖ Repository interfaces follow dependency inversion
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies in domain layer

> **Coming Soon**: Additional milestone scripts will be added as we implement subsequent tutorial parts (Application Layer, Infrastructure Layer, API Layer, etc.)

## Output Interpretation

Each script uses color-coded output to indicate status:

- üß™ **Blue**: Test section headers
- ‚úÖ **Green**: Successful checks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Warnings (may be OK depending on implementation stage)
- ‚ùå **Red**: Failures that need attention
- üí° **Light**: Tips and suggestions

## Best Practices

1. **Run milestone checks frequently** - Don't wait until the end of a part
2. **Fix issues immediately** - Address failures before moving to the next part
3. **Use warnings as guidance** - Yellow warnings often indicate missing optional components
4. **Check dependencies** - Some scripts verify that required tools are installed

## Integration with Development Workflow

Use milestone scripts to verify your progress:

```bash
# During development
make milestone-part2  # Check current progress

# Before moving to next part
make milestone-part2  # Ensure Part 2 is complete
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: Usually indicate the part hasn't been implemented yet
```
‚ùå Import error: No module named 'src.domain.entities'
üí° Domain layer may not be fully implemented yet
```

**Missing Files**: Check that you've created the expected directory structure
```
‚ùå CDK directory not found
```

**Tool Dependencies**: Install required tools (pytest, CDK CLI, AWS CLI)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CDK CLI not installed or not in PATH
```

### Getting Help

- Check the main project README for setup instructions
- Use `make help` to see all available commands
- Review the tutorial documentation for implementation guidance
- Each script provides specific guidance on what needs to be implemented
